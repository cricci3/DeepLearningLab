# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with CNN

## Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented in PyTorch. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images categorized into 10 different classes, such as airplanes, automobiles, cats, and dogs. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Our goal is to train a deep learning model to achieve a test accuracy of at least 65%, with potential improvements beyond 78% through various optimizations.

This project demonstrates the process of training a CNN for image classification using PyTorch. By following a structured approach, I achieved high test accuracy and improved performance through careful experimentation and tuning.
